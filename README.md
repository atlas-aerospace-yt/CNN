# CNN
Computer Neural Network:

This is an ongoing project to create an easy to use Neural Network in python.

The goal is to be able to enter inputs and outputs then have the entire model calculated and trained with no fuss.

Currently, the code generates the model with random weights and can do forward propagation with the random weights.

I am currently working on backwards propagation and optimisation.
